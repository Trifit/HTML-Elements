# Html components
This is a repository of well crafted basic html, components, framework agnostic and non dependant of any other library, so they are as modular as possible.

# Quickstart
1. Clone the repository into your local, by clicking on the clone button. Or download specific file with - `git archive --remote=https://github.com/Trifit/componets.git HEAD README.md`.
2. Run `yarn parcel index.html` or `yarn parcel index.html`.
3. You should see a list of components and instructions on how to implement them (if not, I was too lazy or too forgetfull).

## Component list
1. **Modal dialog** (src/dialog.js) -> requires a trigger `<button>` with `js-open-dialog` class in the html.
